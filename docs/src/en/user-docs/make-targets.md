# Make Targets

`make` is the main development and source-based authoring interface of this repository.

Published profiles are consumed through `pk3s` or `productive-k3s-infra`, not through a dedicated runtime CLI in this repo:

```bash
pk3s infra install multipass-1-server-2-agents
./productive-k3s-infra.sh profile install --tgz ./multipass-1-server-2-agents.tgz
```

The targets below remain intentionally source-based and are aimed at repository development, CI, and scenario authoring.

## Root-level targets

| `make test-checkstatus` | Summarize the currently recorded matrix test outcomes from local artifacts |
| `make test-static` | Run static checks across all public scenarios |
| `make test-contract` | Run contract checks across all public scenarios |
| `make test-live` | Run live validations across all public scenarios |
| `make test-live-onprem-arm` | Run only the public ARM live validation through `scenarios/edge/onprem-basic-arm` |
| `make test-live-gha-onprem` | Run the GitHub-hosted single-node `onprem-basic` live validation |
| `make test-aws-localstack-contract` | Run the AWS single-node infrastructure contract validation against LocalStack |
| `make test-matrix` | Run `static`, `contract`, and `live` in sequence |
| `make scenario-up SCENARIO=...` | Run `up` on the selected scenario through one generic entrypoint |
| `make scenario-down SCENARIO=...` | Run `down` on the selected scenario when that scenario supports it |
| `make scenario-status SCENARIO=...` | Run `status` on the selected scenario |
| `make scenario-infra-up SCENARIO=...` | Run `infra-up` on the selected scenario when that scenario supports it |

| `make multipass` | Run the default public `multipass` flow (`up`) |
| `make onprem` | Run the default public `onprem-basic` flow (`up`) |
| `make onprem-arm` | Run the default public `onprem-basic-arm` flow (`up`) |
| `make aws-single-node` | Run the default public AWS single-node flow (`up`) |

Accepted `SCENARIO` values:

- `multipass`
- `onprem`
- `onprem-arm`
- `aws-single-node`

The short aliases above are only convenience wrappers for `up`. The `scenario-...` targets are the recommended generic interface.

## Notes

!!! note
    The public package-first operator interface belongs to `pk3s` and `productive-k3s-infra`. This repository keeps the source-oriented targets that feed those published artifacts.

!!! note
    `status` is important in this repository because generated metadata is part of the operating model, not just an internal implementation detail.
